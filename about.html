    <p>Covid took them away mercilessly and struggling with science, as we did, could not bid them farewell. This Tribute to front line corona warriors is a space for the thousands of doctores whom we lost to Covid fury. It has stories engraved in words that shed tears. The unsung tunes of our tribute to the Covid Martyrs are kept here. The nation does this with a heart that shower flowers at them, with pain that could never get expressed and heaps of salutes that they command for ever. It all came like a lightening but we keep them here with the light of eternity and the bliss of proximity.</p>
